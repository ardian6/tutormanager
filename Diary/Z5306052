Week02
This week, our group carried out the assignment of COMP3900 Proposal. 
I was responsible for part A, which mainly introduced what we will do in the next few weeks, so I think it is an overview. 
After planning the tasks, I started to complete the Proposal homework with my team members. 
And provide help to other team members. At the same time, I will share some problems with other team members and teaching assistants.
