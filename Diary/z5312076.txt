Ardian Magjarraj (z5312076) Diary

Week 1:
Created the team with Michael, Mathew, Ryan and Hayka, where Mathew became the Scrum Master. We reviewed the skills/knowledge of each group member and decided that Project 16 was ideal for our combined skillset. We discussed and defined basic roles for completing the project proposal.
We didn't fully understand how to create the System Architecture diagram and Storyboards for the proposal, because of this we decided to wait for the Week 2 lecture/lab to learn more and ask questions.

Week 2:
The team started work on the project proposal, where I was assigned to creating the Storyboard. I began working on the Storyboard using Balsamiq and collaborated with Ryan to finish a rough draft. We weren't completely confident on creating the Storyboard, but after reviewing the lecture material and learning Balsamiq's features, we felt as if we had a good idea as to how to complete the Storyboard by the due date in Week 3. In our Friday lab we also chose a 8:30 pm meeting time every Wednesday 
which everyone confirmed their availability for.

Week 3:
Struggled with finishing the storyboard, as I wasn't sure of the correct format, so I referred to lecture slides and asked my Mentor for assistance. By Friday week 3, Ryan and I finished the storyboard and met up with the rest of the team to finalise the proposal. We agreed to meet on
the following Monday to talk about coding the project.
